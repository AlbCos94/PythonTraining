QUEUE

A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end, called the "rear", an the removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commonly called "front"

As an element enters the queue it starts at the rear and makes its way towards the front, waiting until that time when it is the next element to be removed

The most recently added item in the queue must wait until at the end of the collection

The item that has been in the collection the longest is at the front

This ordering principle is sometimes called "FIFO" --> first-in, first-out / first come , first served ( e.g waiting line in a cinema)

enqueue --> adding a new item to the rear of the queue
dequeue --> removing the front item from the queue
