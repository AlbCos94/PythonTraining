STACK

A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end

This end is commonly referred as the "top"

The end opposite the top is known as the "base"

Its ordering principle is called LIFO --> Last In First Out

It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection

Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base

push --> to put new element on the top of the stack
pop --> to remove items from the top of the stack

Usefull to reverse the order of items ( e.g. Back Button in a browser)
The order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal
